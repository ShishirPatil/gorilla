## About

**Gorilla enables LLMs to use tools by invoking APIs. Given a natural language query, Gorilla comes up with the semantically- and syntactically- correct API to invoke.** 

With Gorilla, we are the first to demonstrate how to use LLMs to invoke 1,600+ (and growing) API calls accurately while reducing hallucination. This repository contains [inference code](/gorilla/inference) for running Gorilla finetuned models, [evaluation code](/gorilla/eval) for reproducing results from our paper, and [APIBench](/data) - the largest collection of APIs, curated and easy to be trained on!

Since our initial release, we've served ~500k requests and witnessed incredible adoption by developers worldwide. The project has expanded to include tools, evaluations, leaderboard, end-to-end finetuning recipes, infrastructure components, and the Gorilla API Store:

### Installation Options

1. **Gorilla CLI** - Fastest way to get started
```bash
pip install gorilla-cli
gorilla generate 100 random characters into a file called test.txt
```
[Learn more about Gorilla CLI ‚Üí](https://github.com/gorilla-llm/gorilla-cli)

git clone https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla.git
cd gorilla/inference
```
[Detailed local setup instructions ‚Üí](/gorilla/inference/README.md)

openai.api_key = "EMPTY"
openai.api_base = "http://luigi.millennium.berkeley.edu:8000/v1"

# Define your functions
functions = [{
    "name": "get_current_weather",
    "description": "Get weather in a location",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {"type": "string"},

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. I would like to use Gorilla commercially. Is there going to be an Apache 2.0 licensed version?

Yes! We now have models that you can use commercially without any obligations.


2. Can we use Gorilla with other tools like Langchain etc?

Absolutely! You've highlighted a great aspect of our tools. Gorilla is  an  end-to-end model, specifically tailored to serve correct API calls (tools) without requiring any additional coding. It's designed to work as part of a wider ecosystem and can be flexibly integrated within agentic frameworks and other tools.

Langchain, is a versatile developer tool. Its "agents" can efficiently swap in any LLM, Gorilla included, making it a highly adaptable solution for various needs.

The beauty of these tools truly shines when they collaborate, complementing each other's strengths and capabilities to create an even more powerful and comprehensive solution. This is where your contribution can make a difference. We enthusiastically welcome any inputs to further refine and enhance these tools. 

Check out our blog on [How to Use Gorilla: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/5_how_to_gorilla.html) to see all the different ways you can integrate Gorilla in your projects.
