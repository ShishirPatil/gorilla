I\u2019m finally taking those higher-level courses that seemed so far off when I was just a freshman. It\u2019s kind of surreal to be at this stage, you know? It feels like only yesterday I was sitting in an intro class learning about simple data structures, but now I\u2019m all in with complex algorithmic concepts, advanced system design, and stuff even I never thought I\u2019d be tackling, like quantum computing basics."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Let me break it down for you. My favorite class this semester is definitely Advanced Algorithms. I\u2019m a huge fan of theory when it connects directly to real-world problem-solving\u2014like, how do we optimize pathfinding in large networks, or what\u2019s the fastest way to handle huge datasets with minimal time complexity? That kind of problem is super fascinating to me. We\u2019ve been diving into everything from dynamic programming approaches to approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. It really messes with your head sometimes, but in a good, challenging way. Our professor is great; she\u2019s got a knack for explaining these dizzying concepts in a really intuitive manner. She\u2019ll put up a problem on the board\u2014something you\u2019d think is impossible to solve in polynomial time\u2014and then she\u2019ll show us a strategy to at least approximate a solution. Every time I leave that class, my brain\u2019s buzzing."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Aside from that, I\u2019m taking a Distributed Systems course (CS 2631), which is probably the second hardest.

The group project is definitely an adventure. We have to collaborate with folks who have different coding styles and sometimes different ideas of what the final product should look like. But that\u2019s also the beauty of it, right? In a real-world setting, you\u2019re never working in a vacuum. You have to be able to integrate your code with others\u2019 and handle everything from concurrency issues to node failures gracefully. It\u2019s nerve-wracking at times\u2014like last week, I spent hours troubleshooting a weird bug that turned out to be a single misplaced bracket in one of the config files. But once we got that fixed and everything ran smoothly, it was this huge sense of accomplishment.

To be honest, I\u2019ve always been a gamer at heart, so this was a must-take. The professor is actually from the industry; he worked on a couple of indie games that got some decent traction. We\u2019re learning about basic 2D and 3D engines, how to implement physics, and even a bit of user experience design. It\u2019s unbelievably fun because every assignment is super creative. Last time, I had to design a mini-game based on a labyrinth concept, and it was all about balancing the difficulty curve so players wouldn\u2019t get frustrated and quit. Getting that design right was tricky, but it was also rewarding to see it come together."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh! And one class I might\u2019ve regretted signing up for at first but now actually enjoy is this Introduction to Quantum Computing. I know, it sounds so cutting-edge, right? Initially, it was intimidating, but the professor\u2019s approach is to make it more about conceptual understanding than pure math. Of course, there is math\u2014like linear algebra out the wazoo\u2014but it\u2019s interspersed with code examples in frameworks that simulate quantum circuits. We\u2019re not actually building quantum computers or anything, but we\u2019re modeling basic algorithms like Grover\u2019s and Shor\u2019s to see how they theoretically outperform classical methods.

Sounds fancy, but it essentially means reading a firehose of tweets or posts and analyzing them for words that might suggest a disaster or crisis. We\u2019re building an interface that city officials\u2014or maybe campus security\u2014could theoretically use to see real-time alerts. It\u2019s definitely pulling together everything I\u2019ve learned as a CS major: database management, building an API, front-end interface, plus the ML pipeline.

Oh, I\u2019m also technically taking a humanities elective\u2014Philosophy of Mind. It\u2019s my last required non-CS elective, and I chose it because it ties back into AI in some interesting ways. We talk about consciousness, the concept of mind, and how that might apply to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s a smaller class, so we do a lot of class discussions, and that\u2019s a nice change of pace from all the coding in my other classes. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to just sit back and analyze abstract ideas. It also helps me see the bigger picture\u2014like the ethical implications of building AI systems that could one day mimic or simulate human thinking. Two weeks ago, I wrote a paper on whether strong AI could ever truly experience qualia\u2014like the subjective experience of color or pain.

Philosophy of Mind is on Thursday evenings, which can be brutal if I\u2019m tired from the rest of the day. But hey, it\u2019s senior year, and I gotta push through. Fridays, I keep open\u2014no scheduled classes, but inevitably I\u2019m working on assignments, group projects, or labs.

Capstone alone can eat up a solid ten hours a week\u2014more if you run into a big bug or if your model\u2019s not training properly. Then the distributed systems project is another black hole for time. My group tries to meet at least twice a week. We also rely heavily on Slack or Discord to keep each other updated. But you know how it can go: coordinating five different people\u2019s schedules is a mini-nightmare. Still, as stressful as it can be, it\u2019s also exciting.

I used to dread the tougher CS classes because I was worried I wouldn\u2019t keep up, but at this stage, I\u2019ve gotten better at problem-solving and time management. I still pull the occasional late night\u2014once in a while you just can\u2019t avoid it, especially if something\u2019s due the next day and you\u2019re stuck debugging. But it\u2019s never as scary as it once was. Being a senior has given me a sense of confidence; I know if I grind and keep my eye on the end goal, I\u2019ll eventually figure things out. I guess that\u2019s the biggest takeaway: after four years, you learn how to be resourceful, how to collaborate, and how to think critically. These classes are tough, no doubt, but they\u2019re also super rewarding.

I swear, the moment I felt that rush of wind against the sails, I was hooked. Now in college, I\u2019ve tried to keep up with it whenever I go back home for breaks. There\u2019s a local sailing club back there that rents out boats at a decent student rate, so I\u2019ll sign up for a day, invite a friend if they want to come, and just spend hours on the water. I love the sense of freedom it gives me. Everything else \u2014 Looming deadlines, bug fixes in code, group project drama \u2014 just fades into the background. Out there, the water\u2019s choppy, the wind\u2019s unpredictable, and you\u2019ve got to keep your head in the game.

I started with a basic lifting routine freshman year \u2014 a friend of mine from the dorm taught me the fundamentals, like proper form for squats and deadlifts, how to program workouts, and stuff like that. Now, I try to hit the gym around four times a week. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to become a bodybuilder or anything, but I love seeing incremental improvements. If I can lift just a bit more weight this month than last, or if I have a little more energy in my daily life, I chalk that up as a win. Plus, it\u2019s a great stress-reliever after some marathon coding session. The mental clarity I get after a good workout is unreal.

Lately, I\u2019ve been really into co-op survival games \u2014 the kind where you have to gather resources, build shelters, fend off creatures, and so on. I guess that\u2019s because I enjoy problem-solving in an environment that\u2019s a bit more chill than debugging a giant codebase. Once in a while, I also hop into fast-paced shooters, especially if some of my buddies from class are online and want to team up. It\u2019s both a social thing and a mental challenge for me. I know some people see gaming purely as a waste of time, but I think it can be strategic and collaborative \u2014 plus, it\u2019s a great way to stay connected. I\u2019ve also dabbled in game development a little bit, mostly messing around in Unity or Unreal Engine for fun.

Most recently, I\u2019ve been obsessed with sci-fi that deals with artificial intelligence \u2014 it\u2019s partly driven by my academic interests, to be honest. I like imagining future technology and how it might blur boundaries between humans and machines. My favorite AI-themed sci-fi book right now is 'The Infinity Courts' by Akemi Dawn Bowman. Books like that also help me consider the ethical and social implications of what I\u2019m studying, so in a weird way, reading isn\u2019t just relaxation; it\u2019s also helping me explore more philosophical questions about the work I\u2019ll probably be doing after graduation.

Well, in our lab, we deal with datasets that are tens of terabytes in size. Trying to visualize that so that a domain expert (like an astrophysicist) can quickly glean insights is no joke. So one of my main tasks is working on front-end prototypes that take slices of data and present them in dynamic, interactive dashboards.

But eventually, I realized that the campus experience is about way more than just academics. So I jumped into a couple of different student organizations. One big one is the Computer Science Society\u2014they host these weekly meetups where we discuss new technologies, share personal projects, and sometimes have industry speakers come in. It\u2019s a really welcoming environment, even for beginners. Often, if I\u2019m stuck on a tricky concept or need insight into a topic like concurrency or containerization, I can chat with fellow members who might have worked on something similar in an internship."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Beyond that, there\u2019s this VR/AR Club I\u2019ve been attending on and off since my sophomore year. I got hooked once I started doing research in immersive analytics, so it was natural for me to want to hang out with people who share that passion. The club is surprisingly hands-on\u2014they have a little VR lab in the corner of the engineering building, complete with headsets, sensors, and some quirky prototypes that were built by past members. We\u2019ll host demos where each person shows off their latest project, whether it\u2019s a mini-game or something more experimental like augmented reality interfaces for everyday tasks. A few weeks back, someone showcased their AR tutor concept for advanced math: you\u2019d point your phone at an equation on your paper, and it would pop up a hint or a 3D demonstration. That kind of creativity inspires me to push my own research further. I just love the supportive vibe you get when people are genuinely excited about emerging tech."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Of course, the campus is also big on non-tech stuff. I\u2019m not super involved in it, but I do pop into the student-run radio station events now and then. They host these open-mic nights that are a blast\u2014people sing, read poetry, or perform stand-up comedy. I remember one night, a friend of mine from the Distributed Systems class performed an acoustic set. He\u2019s usually so quiet in class, but on stage, he was belting out these soulful tunes as if he was born for it. Moments like that remind me there\u2019s always more to someone than meets the eye when you\u2019re just coding together or doing group projects."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Now, the campus itself has these iconic spots\u2014like the huge central lawn where a lot of students like to hang out between classes. It\u2019s common for student organizations to set up booths there. You can walk through and see fliers for everything from an a cappella group to an environmental activism society. They\u2019ll hand out freebies like stickers or candy to lure you into signing up for their mailing list. My personal kryptonite is free pizza, so whenever a club includes that in their advertisement\u2014well, let\u2019s just say they can easily tempt me. The lawn is also where some of the biggest campus events take place, like our annual Tech Fest. During Tech Fest, different project teams put up posters, do live demos of their prototypes, and recruiters sometimes roam around looking for potentially innovative ideas. It\u2019s kind of a big deal here, especially for engineering and CS folks."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "I\u2019d say campus culture is fairly collaborative. There are definitely pockets of competition\u2014especially among seniors trying to land top internships or job offers\u2014but overall, people want to help each other succeed. I remember in my second year, the campus hackathon was a huge eye-opener. Thousands of students from various backgrounds, from first-years to master\u2019s candidates, crammed into the student center for 24 or 36 hours straight, hacking away. It was chaotic but exhilarating. You\u2019d see beginners learning the basics of GitHub while advanced teams used complex machine learning libraries to do, like, real-time image recognition. Sponsors and mentors wandered around to see if anyone needed help. I formed a small team with a few casual acquaintances, none of us were super close friends. But the bond we formed during that all-nighter\u2014eating stale pizza at 3 a.m., debugging code, deliriously cheering each other on\u2014was unlike anything I\u2019d experienced before. That\u2019s the vibe I associate with campus life: you\u2019re all in the trenches together, forging friendships through these shared experiences and challenges."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Speaking of forging connections, dorm life can be another huge part of campus culture, although I\u2019ve moved off-campus now. In my first two years, I stayed in a dorm that was specifically for engineering majors\u2014 \u201cThe Engi-House,\u201d as we jokingly called it. Let me tell you, the late-night coding sessions in the common lounge were legendary. Someone would be banging away on an assignment for Data Structures, while another group might be streaming e-sports tournaments. Occasionally, that environment got a little too intense\u2014imagine a bunch of stressed-out engineers hopped up on energy drinks. But it also meant that if you ran into a stumbling block, there was always someone nearby who could offer a quick pointer. And beyond academics, we\u2019d hold potlucks, watch Netflix together, or even host a small talent show as a way to blow off steam."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Another big part of campus life, at least for me, has been volunteering at some of the outreach events. Our CS department organizes a \u201cTech for Good\u201d day where local high school students come to campus to learn about programming and problem-solving. Volunteers like me help run mini-workshops on topics like web development or basic Python. It\u2019s really rewarding to see younger students light up when they manage to make a simple game or animated webpage. Sometimes, I remember how I felt at that age\u2014like the whole tech world was so big and I had no idea where to start. Giving them a positive first experience is something I take pride in. Plus, events like that show a different side of campus: it\u2019s not just about academic research or class assignments; it\u2019s about engaging with the community and hopefully inspiring the next generation to get excited about STEM fields."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "We also have a pretty lively social scene if you need a break from all the academic stuff. Greek life is there for those who are into it, though I never joined a fraternity myself. Instead, I found that the best way to meet people who share your interests is through specialized clubs. For instance, one of my friends is super into robotics. He joined the Robotics Team in his first semester and practically found his second family there\u2014these are the people he now hangs out with on weekends, goes to watch movies with, and grabs dinner with. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve grown closer to folks in the VR/AR Club and the CS Society.

I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s bittersweet because it\u2019s the last hurrah before everyone scatters. Some of my older pals who graduated last year said it was one of the best weeks of their college life, filled with laughter, nostalgia, and a bit of that sinking feeling that the journey\u2019s almost over. I\u2019m both excited and a little anxious for it. I\u2019ve been here for four years, made so many memories, and it\u2019s weird to think about not being a student anymore."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Now, let me not forget the campus traditions. Every year, there\u2019s this big Rivalry Game\u2014our sports teams face off against our biggest rival college in a variety of sports. Even though I\u2019m not a dedicated sports fan, I absolutely love the energy on campus that week. People deck themselves out in school colors, paint their faces, and parade around with banners. Sometimes, the night before the big football game, we have a massive pep rally that includes fireworks. It\u2019s a spectacle. Even if you don\u2019t go to the game itself, the vibe on campus is electric. Friends gather in dorm lounges or local bars to watch and cheer. If we win, the celebrations can last all weekend, and if we lose, well, we still find a way to commiserate together. It\u2019s a unifying moment for everyone, from business majors to art students to us nerdy engineers."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "One cool development is that our school\u2019s e-sports team has gained official recognition. A lot of people think that a campus\u2019s \u201csports scene\u201d is only about basketball or football, but now we have an arena for e-sports as well. If you step inside during a tournament, you\u2019ll see this wide seating area and a big screen where they\u2019re streaming the competitions live. It\u2019s not uncommon for a hundred or more students to gather and cheer on our team for League of Legends or Overwatch matches. I never would\u2019ve guessed e-sports would be a legitimate campus institution when I started college, but times are changing. It\u2019s awesome to see a broader definition of competition and community."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "We have an annual event called the \u201cMidnight Breakfast\u201d during finals week.

Professors come to serve food, the school band might perform, and everyone collectively takes a break from cramming. It\u2019s such a small thing, but it does wonders to remind you that you\u2019re not alone in feeling anxious about final exams.

I\u2019ve been exploring software engineering roles that overlap with the fields I\u2019ve grown passionate about\u2014data visualization, VR/AR technologies, and maybe some data-driven product development. Over the past couple of years, especially through my research experience, I\u2019ve discovered this love for making huge datasets approachable and interactive. I keep fantasizing about how that might translate into a commercial product or even an open-source framework that can benefit a wider community. That\u2019s one reason I\u2019m drawn to certain tech companies known for pushing boundaries in data analytics or immersive technologies\u2014places like Unity, Unreal, or even some lesser-known startups working on specialized VR solutions for healthcare or engineering. One of my lab mentors basically told me, \u2018Follow the domain that excites you, not just the biggest name brand out there.\u2019 That advice really clicked. Sure, the Googles, Amazons, and Facebooks (or Meta, I guess) of the world are tempting, but so are these smaller companies where I might have a bigger impact earlier on."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "As for my actual search process, I\u2019m in the thick of campus recruiting right now. We have career fairs, which can be both exhilarating and stressful. I\u2019ve already submitted a bunch of applications, mostly for software engineering or data engineering intern-to-full-time conversion roles. Luckily, I did an internship last summer at a tech startup with 9 people that specialized in data analytics software for logistics companies. It was such a valuable experience because I got to see how a real development team operates, how they plan sprints, manage code reviews, and handle feature rollouts to actual paying clients. My tasks ranged from building small UI components for their analytics dashboard to writing data pipelines that process shipping events in near real-time. By the end of that internship, I felt more confident in my skills, and I think that\u2019s going to help me stand out when I interview."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "On the grad school front: part of me is really intrigued by the idea of continuing my research in immersive analytics or even branching into human-computer interaction for large datasets.

Writing those workshop papers and currently working on a conference submission has shown me that I do enjoy the deeper exploration of a single topic\u2014figuring out how to push the needle forward in a meaningful way. But on the flip side, there\u2019s a practical consideration: I\u2019d like to apply what I\u2019ve learned in a more commercial setting, at least for a while, before I commit another five to six years for a PhD (or even two if I go for a master\u2019s first). Some of my peers say I could do a master\u2019s part-time while working. Others say it\u2019s better to go all-in if I\u2019m going to do it.

It\u2019s not just about coding for me; it\u2019s about working closely with people, brainstorming solutions, putting together prototypes, seeing them fail, and then iterating until they work. That\u2019s exactly the type of environment I want once I graduate. I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t want a role where I\u2019m locked away on tiny, siloed tasks. I\u2019d love to end up at a company that encourages cross-functional collaboration\u2014with designers, data scientists, product managers, or even domain experts in non-tech fields.

After a few days there, I headed to Kyoto, which was the total opposite vibe\u2014very calm and historical.

If I\u2019m feeling ambitious, I\u2019ll whip up some scrambled eggs and spinach, maybe have a piece of whole wheat toast, and brew coffee using one of those single-cup machines we all share. If I\u2019m rushed, I\u2019ll just grab a granola bar and some fruit to eat while I head to campus. I try to be economical with time while making sure I eat something relatively nutritious. I\u2019m pretty active, so I can\u2019t slack on breakfast too often."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Because I\u2019ve strategically scheduled most of my classes in the late morning or early afternoon, I don\u2019t need to leave super early. My first class typically starts at 9:30 or 10:00 A.M. This semester, I\u2019ve got Advanced Algorithms and a Machine Learning elective, as well as a project-based course focusing on distributed systems. It\u2019s a full load, but I kind of enjoy diving into complex topics. During the 15-minute walk to campus, I often put in my earbuds and listen to either a lecture recording (if I\u2019m behind on something) or a music playlist that helps me get in the zone for the day."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Once I get to campus, I usually find a seat in the student center or a quiet corner of the library to finalize any small tasks\u2014maybe a last-minute tweak to code for a morning lab or adjusting my to-do list for the day. I use a digital task manager that syncs across my devices, so I can reference it whenever. Having all my tasks in one place forces me to stay organized. I categorize tasks by class or project, and I try to break them down into smaller subtasks with clear deadlines. It helps me avoid feeling overwhelmed by big deadlines looming weeks away."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "Class time itself usually extends until around 2:00 P.M. or 3:00 P.M., with a midday break in between. I\u2019ll grab a quick lunch on campus\u2014my go-to is often a turkey and avocado wrap from one of the campus bistros. While I eat, I tend to check email and Slack messages from my research group, where I\u2019m helping develop a computer vision application for analyzing images of marine traffic. My professor likes to set weekly milestones, so I need to constantly keep track of where we are in the cycle. On top of that, I\u2019m part of a programming club that does hackathon prep, and they also often post about upcoming events or workshops. Staying on top of all these alerts is critical, or I\u2019ll miss something important."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "In the afternoon, if I don\u2019t have a lab session or a group project meeting, I\u2019ll head over to the gym for a quick workout\u2014maybe 45 minutes to an hour. I like to do a mix of cardio and weight training. Honestly, exercise is a real stress reliever for me, plus it keeps my energy levels up. I\u2019ve discovered that if I skip the gym too many days in a row, I can\u2019t focus as well on my coding tasks. It\u2019s like the stress seeps into my brain and distracts me. So I consider my workout time to be non-negotiable unless I have a pressing exam or a massive deadline that literally can\u2019t wait."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "By late afternoon, I\u2019m usually found in the computer lab or at the library again. That\u2019s prime coding time for me. If we have a group project, we\u2019ll meet in one of the collaboration rooms\u2014a couple of the guys and I are currently working on this distributed system that handles real-time data from sensor networks. It\u2019s pretty cool, but we\u2019ve got layers upon layers of abstraction to keep track of, and version control is a must. We use GitHub for everything, and each of us has a set of responsibilities. Right now, I'm working on optimizing the database queries so that the system can scale more smoothly when multiple nodes are streaming data at once. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, but that\u2019s where time management skills come into play. We set up a shared project board, with each card assigned to someone, and we mark everything with due dates. That helps keep the entire team accountable and aware of each person\u2019s workload."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "I\u2019ll typically leave campus around 6:00 or 7:00 P.M., depending on how immersed I get in my work or if I have a campus club meeting. I\u2019m part of the Robotics Club, which meets once a week in the early evening. Even though it\u2019s not strictly my main focus area, robotics projects are a good cross-disciplinary experience, and you never know when those skills or knowledge might come in handy."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "When I get home, I'll settle in for dinner\u2014maybe some pasta or anything simple, especially if I\u2019m trying to get back to coding or studying quickly. After dinner, around 8:00 or 9:00 P.M., I fall into my study groove again. This is when I\u2019ll do my heavier reading or work on major code tasks\u2014like finishing lab reports, writing up research notes for the professor, or polishing slides for a group presentation. There are days I lose track of time and look up to see it\u2019s suddenly midnight. But most evenings, I try to cut off academic work by 11:00 P.M. so I can decompress. Decompression might be gaming with friends (online co-op games, usually) or reading a novel I've been working through. Recently, I\u2019ve tried to read more outside of textbooks, just to diversify my mental input. Then, I\u2019ll do a quick review of my schedule for the next day\u2014just a glance at pressing deadlines, any meetings, or appointments. It helps ease any anxiety before I go to bed."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "On weekends, time management looks a bit different. Saturdays might be partially dedicated to longer assignments or bigger project milestones. But I also make space for fun stuff\u2014maybe a sailing trip if the weather\u2019s nice, or hanging out at a friend\u2019s place for a casual gathering. Sundays, I attend a group study session with seven other classmates to prep for the week ahead. That\u2019s where we catch up on each other\u2019s workload and share tips or resources. Sometimes, I even go over internship or job application things on Sunday, just to keep everything in check for post-graduation planning."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "If there\u2019s one main strategy I\u2019d recommend to anyone, it\u2019s to keep a single, unified to-do list and calendar that reflect your actual priorities. For me, it\u2019s a digital solution because I can\u2019t carry a planner everywhere, but some people do well with bullet journals. As long as you know where you stand on assignments, projects, or personal goals, you\u2019ll feel more in control. Also, don\u2019t forget to schedule downtime. It sounds counterintuitive, but letting your brain breathe helps you come back stronger and more productive. Even if it\u2019s just an hour at the end of the day to watch a show or play with your dog, it matters."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "That\u2019s pretty much how my day-to-day goes. Sure, there are days when an unexpected bug throws off my schedule, or a meeting ends up running long, or I just feel unmotivated and need a break. But for the most part, sticking to a routine with enough flexibility built in has been a huge help. College is short, but I want to make the most of it\u2014and staying on top of things is the only way I know how to keep moving forward without feeling like I\u2019m drowning. It\u2019s not perfect, but hopefully it gives you a glimpse into how I handle my time and keep my sanity intact."}]], "involved_classes": ["MemoryAPI"], "scenario": "student"}
