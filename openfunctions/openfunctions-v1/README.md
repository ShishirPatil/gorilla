## Introduction
Gorilla OpenFunctions extends Large Language Model(LLM) Chat Completion feature to formulate 
executable APIs call given natural language instructions and API context.

## Models Available
|Model | Functionality|
|---|---|
|gorilla-openfunctions-v0 | Given a function, and user intent, returns properly formatted json with the right arguments|
|gorilla-openfunctions-v1 | + Parallel functions, and can choose between functions|

All of our models are hosted on our Huggingface UC Berkeley gorilla-llm org: [gorilla-openfunctions-v0](https://huggingface.co/gorilla-llm/gorilla-openfunctions-v0) and [gorilla-openfunctions-v1](https://huggingface.co/gorilla-llm/gorilla-openfunctions-v1).

## Example Usage

1. OpenFunctions is compatible with OpenAI Functions

```bash
!pip install openai==0.28.1
```

2. Point to Gorilla hosted servers

```python
import openai

def get_gorilla_response(prompt="Call me an Uber ride type \"Plus\" in Berkeley at zipcode 94704 in 10 minutes", model="gorilla-openfunctions-v0", functions=[]):
  openai.api_key = "EMPTY"
  openai.api_base = "http://luigi.millennium.berkeley.edu:8000/v1"
  try:
    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      model="gorilla-openfunctions-v1",
      temperature=0.0,
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
      functions=functions,
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
  except Exception as e:
    print(e, model, prompt)
```

3. Pass the user argument and set of functions, Gorilla OpenFunctions returns a fully formatted json

```python
query = "Call me an Uber ride type \"Plus\" in Berkeley at zipcode 94704 in 10 minutes"
functions = [
    {
        "name": "Uber Carpool",
        "api_name": "uber.ride",
        "description": "Find suitable ride for customers given the location, type of ride, and the amount of time the customer is willing to wait as parameters",
        "parameters":  [{"name": "loc", "description": "location of the starting place of the uber ride"}, {"name":"type", "enum": ["plus", "comfort", "black"], "description": "types of uber ride user is ordering"}, {"name": "time", "description": "the amount of time in minutes the customer is willing to wait"}]
    }
]
get_gorilla_response(query, functions=functions)
```

4. Expected output

```bash
uber.ride(loc="berkeley", type="plus", time=10)
```

## Running OpenFunctions Locally

You can try this out on our [Local OpenFunctions Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I9UJoKh9sngE2MfPfQD5kbn2-twq2xvY?usp=sharing) to see how it works!

If you want to Run OpenFunctions locally, here is the prompt format that we used: 

```python
def get_prompt(user_query, functions=[]):
  if len(functions) == 0:
    return f"USER: <<question>> {user_query}\nASSISTANT: "
  functions_string = json.dumps(functions)
  return f"USER: <<question>> {user_query} <<function>> {functions_string}\nASSISTANT: "
```

Note: Use the `get_prompt` format only if you are hosting it Locally. If you are using the Berkeley hosted models through the Chat-completion API, we do this in the backend, so you don't have to do this. The model is supported in Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Transformers and can be run up locally:

```python
import json
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline

def get_prompt(user_query: str, functions: list = []) -> str:
    """
    Generates a conversation prompt based on the user's query and a list of functions.

    Parameters:
    - user_query (str): The user's query.
    - functions (list): A list of functions to include in the prompt.

    Returns:
    - str: The formatted conversation prompt.
    """
    if len(functions) == 0:
        return f"USER: <<question>> {user_query}\nASSISTANT: "
    functions_string = json.dumps(functions)
    return f"USER: <<question>> {user_query} <<function>> {functions_string}\nASSISTANT: "

# Device setup
device : str = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32

# Model and tokenizer setup
model_id : str = "gorilla-llm/gorilla-openfunctions-v0"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True)

# Move model to device
model.to(device)

# Pipeline setup
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_new_tokens=128,
    batch_size=16,
    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,
    device=device,
)

# Example usage
query: str = "Call me an Uber ride type \"Plus\" in Berkeley at zipcode 94704 in 10 minutes"
functions = [
    {
        "name": "Uber Carpool",
        "api_name": "uber.ride",
        "description": "Find suitable ride for customers given the location, type of ride, and the amount of time the customer is willing to wait as parameters",
        "parameters":  [
            {"name": "loc", "description": "Location of the starting place of the Uber ride"},
            {"name": "type", "enum": ["plus", "comfort", "black"], "description": "Types of Uber ride user is ordering"},
            {"name": "time", "description": "The amount of time in minutes the customer is willing to wait"}
        ]
    }
]

# Generate prompt and obtain model output
prompt = get_prompt(query, functions=functions)
output = pipe(prompt)

print(output)
```

## Self-Hosting OpenFunctions

This section provides a guide on how to self-host the OpenFunctions model on your local machine or serve it locally for your enterprise. The server deploys the OpenFunctions-v0 model with uvicorn, while the client interacts with this local server using the OpenAI package (0.28.xx). 

### Setting Up Your Local Server

The server API endpoint mirrors the interface of the API call executed by `openai.ChatCompletion.create`, ensuring compatibility with clients using the OpenAI package.

Ensure you have the required libraries:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers torch
```

Similar to the process outlined in the "Running OpenFunctions Locally" section, the model is loaded from HuggingFace for local serving. Only use the `get_prompt` format if you are hosting locally.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import torch
from transformers import pipeline, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import uvicorn
import json

# Define the API request model
class ChatCompletionRequest(BaseModel):
    model: str
    temperature: float
    messages: list
    functions: list = []

# Initialize the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Device setup
device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32

# Model and tokenizer setup
model_id = "gorilla-llm/gorilla-openfunctions-v0"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True)

# Move model to device
model.to(device)

# Pipeline setup
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_new_tokens=128,
    batch_size=16,
    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,
    device=device,
)

# Function to generate prompt
def get_prompt(user_query: str, functions: list) -> str:
    """
    Generates a conversation prompt based on the user's query and a list of functions.

    Parameters:
    - user_query (str): The user's query.
    - functions (list): A list of functions to include in the prompt.

    Returns:
    - str: The formatted conversation prompt.
    """
    if len(functions) == 0:
        return f"USER: <<question>> {user_query}\nASSISTANT: "
    functions_string = json.dumps(functions)
    return f"USER: <<question>> {user_query} <<function>> {functions_string}\nASSISTANT: "

# API endpoint
@app.post("/chat/completions")
async def chat_completion(request: ChatCompletionRequest):
    user_query = request.messages[0]['content']
    prompt = get_prompt(user_query, request.functions)
    output = pipe(prompt)
    generated_text = output[0]['generated_text']

    # Return in the format expected by OpenAI package
    return {
        "id": "0",
        "object": "text_completion",
        "created": 0,
        "model": request.model,
        "choices": [{"text": generated_text, "index": 0, "logprobs": None, "finish_reason": "length"}]
    }

# Run the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Setting Up the Client

Ensure you have the required libraries:
```bash
!pip install openai==0.28.1
```

The example client below demonstrates how to interact with the locally hosted OpenFunctions model using `openai.ChatCompletion.create`, akin to using Gorilla hosted servers.

```python
import openai

def get_gorilla_response(prompt="Call me an Uber ride type \"Plus\" in Berkeley at zipcode 94704 in 10 minutes", model="gorilla-openfunctions-v0", functions=[]):
    """
    Sends a request to the self-hosted OpenFunctions model and retrieves the response.

    This function configures the OpenAI API to interact with a local server instance of the OpenFunctions model. 
    It sends a prompt along with optional model specifications and functions, then returns the model's text response.

    Parameters:
    - prompt (str): The user's query.
    - model (str): The identifier for the specific model version to be used. Defaults to "gorilla-openfunctions-v0".
    - functions (list): An optional list of functions providing context for the model's response.

    Returns:
    - str: The text response generated by the model.

    Raises:
    - Exception: If there's an issue with processing the request or communicating with the server.
    """
    openai.api_key = "EMPTY"
    openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8000"  # Point to the local server
    try:
        completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gorilla-openfunctions-v0",
            temperature=0.0,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            functions=functions,
        )
        return completion.choices[0].text
    except Exception as e:
        print(e, model, prompt)

# Example usage
query: str = "Get the latest news headlines from CNN."
functions = [
    {
        "name": "News Headlines",
        "api_call": "news.get_headlines",
        "description": "Retrieve the latest news headlines from a specific news source.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "source": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The news source, e.g. CNN"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "source"
            ]
        }
    }
]

resp = get_gorilla_response(query, functions=functions)
print(resp)
```

### Try Out Self-Hosting OpenFunctions on Colab
You can try out setting up a local server to self-host the OpenFunctions model using this [OpenFunctions Self-Hosted Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aBxYJ9VncxDRN1-DyMT3J-ozmCRRvSje?usp=sharing).
Make sure you select an A100/V100 instance to run the notebook â€“ smaller instances like T-4 do not suffice due to memory constraints.
To remotely access the server running on the Colab instance from a local client, ngrok is used to tunnel the server ports from the Colab instance to public URLs. Instructions for setting up ngrok are provided in the notebook.
