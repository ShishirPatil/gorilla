## FAQ(s)

1. I would like to use Gorilla commercially. Is there going to be an Apache 2.0 licensed version?

Yes! We now have models that you can use commercially without any obligations.


2. Can we use Gorilla with other tools like Langchain etc?

Absolutely! You've highlighted a great aspect of our tools. Gorilla is  an  end-to-end model, specifically tailored to serve correct API calls (tools) without requiring any additional coding. It's designed to work as part of a wider ecosystem and can be flexibly integrated within agentic frameworks and other tools.

Langchain, is a versatile developer tool. Its "agents" can efficiently swap in any LLM, Gorilla included, making it a highly adaptable solution for various needs.

The beauty of these tools truly shines when they collaborate, complementing each other's strengths and capabilities to create an even more powerful and comprehensive solution. This is where your contribution can make a difference. We enthusiastically welcome any inputs to further refine and enhance these tools.
